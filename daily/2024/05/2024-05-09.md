#### hypervisor

1. Boot Linux, But don't have x86_64 pci support.
2. RK3588 board. Boot from the hardware. When finished x86_64.
3. Run arceos and linux based on qemu. Has basic features.

## Driver Framework for multi kernel.

> polyhal is a rust crate that help kernel to support multi kernel and multi platform.

1. write a driver that have less relation with kernel.
2. e1000 driver can run linux and arceos.
3. NVME driver not support linux.
4. drvier depends on driver, such as video or screen depends on i2c or spi. If the OS want to print a pixel(using SPI based screen), then needs to call spi interface. 

## Test
